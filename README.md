### This is my solution to the task intermediate level in Flutter Circle



* Task 1 :
I made oop base class Account and two sub classes ( savings account and checking account):
the classes allow making account on the bank and features like add or withdraw money from it 
----

* Task 2 :
the task was to remove duplicates and sort the students in descending order based on their score 
i made this using map to map each name with the highest score to do the first subtask
and then i convert it to list and sort it based on the score and print it
